# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a webpage Study Guide for the material covered in our course Prework. This webpage provides a structured and easy to read collection of notes from the Prework material. While building this webpage, I learned basic web development concepts in the HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages, along with the basics of the Git version control process.

The webpage is broken into individual boxes containing notes on specific topics, such as HTMl, CSS and JavaScript. This webpage also contains a script.js file containing functions that will list the topics we covered in the Prework and choose one topic at random for us to study first. You can view this JavaScript in the console tab of your browser DevTools.
