        <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. HTML elements are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
            <li>The <body> element is a semantic HTML element. In semantic elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a web page.</li>
            <li> Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content. For our Prework Study Guide, we want to cover the following major topics that we are learning through pre-work.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
